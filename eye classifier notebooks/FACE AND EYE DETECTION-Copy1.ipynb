    "Object Detection using Haar feature-based cascade classifiers is an effective object detection method proposed by Paul Viola and Michael Jones in their paper, \"Rapid Object Detection using a Boosted Cascade of Simple Features\" in 2001. It is a machine learning based approach where a cascade function is trained from a lot of positive and negative images. It is then used to detect objects in other images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, the algorithm needs a lot of positive images (images of faces) and negative images (images without faces) to train the classifier. Then we need to extract features from it. For this, Haar features shown in the below image are used. They are just like our convolutional kernel. Each feature is a single value obtained by subtracting sum of pixels under the white rectangle from sum of pixels under the black rectangle.\n",

    "OpenCV library includes some models already trained for many object detections, for our case there are models for face and eye detection, that can be easily used with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a old model that gives quite good results and can be used at real-time applications, but Haar cascades are notoriously prone to false-positives â€” the Viola-Jones algorithm can easily report a face in an image when no face is present.\n",
    "\n",
    "More modern and accurate models must be taken into account, as this method has now been far surpassed by other methods, such as using Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) + Linear SVM and deep learning (CNN, YOLO). "
