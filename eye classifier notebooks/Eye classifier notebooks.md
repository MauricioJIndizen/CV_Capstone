# JUPYTER NOTEBOOKS

Jupyter notebooks for training our eye classifier model using our dataset, and code for face and eye recognition, and eye classifier.

1) Open Anaconda and execute CMD.exe prompt
2) Change to directory where notebooks has been saved.
3) Create new conda enviromment using command conda create -n name_of_enviromment
4) Activate new enviromment: conda activate name_of_enviromment
5) Install packages with requirements.txt: pip install --user -r requirements.txt
6) Run Jupyter notebook: jupyter notebook
7) Unzip kaggle_dataset.rar and move dataset images (the one that shared on Teams) to this directory

Once you run Jupyter, you can test with your own webcam the FACE AND EYE DETECTION notebook, or try to train a better model changing parameters or architecture of the model in EYE CLASSIFIER TRAINING notebook.
